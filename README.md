# Codebase for the advanced language models course. 

This is a collection of code from exercises I have found potentially useful. "CMU-MiniLlama-exercise-original" contains the original code for a CMU exercise to code a small version on LLama 2 and use it for text generation. "MiniLlama-exercise-alex-solution" contains my solution for that exercise. This could be run at an exercise session

"argilla_generate_a_preference_dataset" is a tutorial about using LLM's to synthetically generate a preference dataset. It will probably not be possible to run at an exercise session, but is interesting as a proof of concept - although you would need another inference engine than the free Huggingface account.
