## Alex description: 

This is my solution for the MinLlama exercise by Neubig from CMU class "CS11-711 Advanced NLP". Link to original exercise (here you will find sections of the code missing - to 
be filled in):

https://github.com/neubig/minllama-assignment/tree/master

That code is also available in the "CMU-MiniLlama-exercise-original" folder.

Here the interesting parts for a DTU exercise could be to implement llama.py, especially parts of the Attention class (compute_query_key_value_scores function), Llamalayer class (forward function) and the generate function in the Llama function. Implementation of the RMSnorm class in llama.py and Adam optimizer in the optimizer.py could be interesting for 
completeness - but can also be skipped for time. Rotary Positional Encoding in rope.py might be a bit more challenging to implement - so it can be an extra assignment - or you might implement normal positional encoding instead.

Regardless you now have a model capable of generating output (for instance see "generated-sentence-temp-0.txt" and "generated-sentence-temp-0.txt"). 

classifier.py is an interesting addition (here you do sentence sentiment analysis) - but it is not suitable for a single exercise session (Note the original exercise is a 2-week assignment in an 8-ECTS course). 

Below is the original description of the exercise (describing the structure and necessary setup). Note that I have put the pre-trained weights for the model used in the exercise in the "models" folder. An alternative to this exercise could be to use the NanoGPT or GPT2 implementation by Karpathy and strip away some code.

run_llama.py is the main script calling all the other scripts and takes various commands.

Running generation (without additional fine-tuning) can be done without a GPU.

# Min-Llama Assignment
by Vijay Viswanathan (based on the previous [minbert-assignment](https://github.com/neubig/minbert-assignment))

This is an exercise in developing a minimalist version of Llama2, part of Carnegie Mellon University's [CS11-711 Advanced NLP](http://phontron.com/class/anlp2024/).

In this assignment, you will implement some important components of the Llama2 model to better understanding its architecture. 
You will then perform sentence classification on ``sst`` dataset and ``cfimdb`` dataset with this model.

## Assignment Details

### Your task
The code to implement can be found in `llama.py`, `classifier.py` and `optimizer.py`. You are reponsible for writing _core components_ of Llama2 (one of the leading open source language models). In doing so, you will gain a strong understanding of neural language modeling. We will load pretrained weights for your language model from `stories42M.pt`; an 8-layer, 42M parameter language model pretrained on the [TinyStories](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.07759) dataset (a dataset of machine-generated children's stories). This model is small enough that it can be trained (slowly) without a GPU. You are encouraged to use Colab or a personal GPU machine (e.g. a Macbook) to be able to iterate more quickly.

Once you have implemented these components, you will test our your model in 3 settings:
1) Generate a text completion (starting with the sentence `"I have wanted to see this thriller for a while, and it didn't disappoint. Keanu Reeves, playing the hero John Wick, is"`). You should see coherent, grammatical English being generated (though the content and topicality of the completion may be absurd, since this LM was pretrained exclusively on children's stories).
2) Perform zero-shot, prompt-based sentiment analysis on two datasets (SST-5 and CFIMDB). This will give bad results (roughly equal to choosing a random target class).
3) Perform task-specific finetuning of your Llama2 model, after implementing a classification head in `classifier.py`. This will give much stronger classification results.
4) If you've done #1-3 well, you will get an A! However, since you've come this far, try implementing something new on top of your hand-written language modeling system! If your method provides strong empirical improvements or demonstrates exceptional creativity, you'll get an A+ on this assignment.

### Important Notes
* Follow `setup.sh` to properly setup the environment and install dependencies.
* There is a detailed description of the code structure in [structure.md](./structure.md), including a description of which parts you will need to implement.
* You are only allowed to use libraries that are installed by `setup.sh`, no other external libraries are allowed (e.g., `transformers`).
* The `data/cfimdb-test.txt` file provided to you does **not** contain gold-labels, and contains a placeholder negative (-1) label. Evaluating your code against this set will show lower accuracies so do not worry if the numbers don't make sense.
* We will run your code with commands below (under "Reference outputs/accuracies"), so make sure that whatever your best results are reproducible using these commands.
    * Do not change any of the existing command options (including defaults) or add any new required parameters

## Reference outputs/accuracies: 

*Text Continuation* (`python run_llama.py --option generate`)
You should see continuations of the sentence `I have wanted to see this thriller for a while, and it didn't disappoint. Keanu Reeves, playing the hero John Wick, is...`. We will generate two continuations - one with temperature 0.0 (which should have a reasonably coherent, if unusual, completion) and one with temperature 1.0 (which is likely to be logically inconsistent and may contain some coherence or grammar errors).

*Zero Shot Prompting*
Zero-Shot Prompting for SST:

`python run_llama.py --option prompt --batch_size 10  --train data/sst-train.txt --dev data/sst-dev.txt --test data/sst-test.txt --label-names data/sst-label-mapping.json --dev_out sst-dev-prompting-output.txt --test_out sst-test-prompting-output.txt [--use_gpu]`

Prompting for SST:
Dev Accuracy: 0.213 (0.000)
Test Accuracy: 0.224 (0.000)

Zero-Shot Prompting for CFIMDB:

`python run_llama.py --option prompt --batch_size 10  --train data/cfimdb-train.txt --dev data/cfimdb-dev.txt --test data/cfimdb-test.txt --label-names data/cfimdb-label-mapping.json --dev_out cfimdb-dev-prompting-output.txt --test_out cfimdb-test-prompting-output.txt [--use_gpu]`

Prompting for CFIMDB:
Dev Accuracy: 0.498 (0.000)
Test Accuracy: -

*Classification Finetuning*

`python run_llama.py --option finetune --epochs 5 --lr 2e-5 --batch_size 80  --train data/sst-train.txt --dev data/sst-dev.txt --test data/sst-test.txt --label-names data/sst-label-mapping.json --dev_out sst-dev-finetuning-output.txt --test_out sst-test-finetuning-output.txt [--use_gpu]`

Finetuning for SST:
Dev Accuracy: 0.414 (0.014)
Test Accuracy: 0.418 (0.017)

`python run_llama.py --option finetune --epochs 5 --lr 2e-5 --batch_size 10  --train data/cfimdb-train.txt --dev data/cfimdb-dev.txt --test data/cfimdb-test.txt --label-names data/cfimdb-label-mapping.json --dev_out cfimdb-dev-finetuning-output.txt --test_out cfimdb-test-finetuning-output.txt [--use_gpu]`

Finetuning for CFIMDB:
Dev Accuracy: 0.800 (0.115)
Test Accuracy: -
